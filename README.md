# Python TensorFlow Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Python project that utilizes TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.

## Overview

The project focuses on implementing machine learning models using TensorFlow to solve various tasks. TensorFlow provides a powerful and flexible platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

## Contents

- `data`: This folder contains the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the usage of TensorFlow for different tasks, including model architecture design, training, and evaluation.
- `scripts`: Python scripts that provide utility functions and helper classes for the machine learning process.
- `results`: This folder stores the evaluation metrics, visualizations, and saved models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including TensorFlow. The notebooks provide step-by-step instructions to build and train models using TensorFlow. You can explore different architectures, experiment with hyperparameters, and adapt the code for your specific machine learning tasks.
